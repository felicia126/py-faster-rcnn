# C++ Inference

Purely C++ inference module for Faster RCNN. The `proposal_layer` is copied from https://github.com/ihooercom/rpn/blob/master/caffe/src/caffe/layers/proposal_layer.cpp 
and some codes are copied from https://github.com/YihangLou/FasterRCNN-Encapsulation-Cplusplus.

# Requirements

My Caffe windows version (https://github.com/happynear/caffe-windows). 

# Configuration

 - Compile the DLL project `caffe.binding`.
 - Change include and library folders in this Faster-RCNN project to your own folders.
 - Compile.
